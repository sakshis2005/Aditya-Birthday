          HAPPY BIRTHDAY ADI🤍 I LOVE YOU AND I WILL ALWAYS DO NO MATTER WHAT.
          We both have had our messy chapters, misunderstandings, ego, stubbornness,
          anger, tears, silence, ignorance—sometimes bad, sometimes overwhelming—but
          somehow we always chose to come back, and that says something about us and
          about what we have.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will not say we are perfect or we are not, but I love how even when we
          hurt each other we still try. I love how you exist in my life not as habit
          but as a feeling. You have seen my weakest, most emotional, most dramatic
          versions. I do not know what the future holds, Adi, but I know what I want...
        </p>
        <p>
          I want our stupid fights, making ups, late night talks, eating with each
          other (and eating each other, you know what I mean), choosing each other,
          and many more such things. Thank you for being you—annoying, stubborn,
          funny, caring, comforting all at once. Thank you for staying, thank you for
          choosing me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I just hope this year brings you peace, success, happiness, and every single
          best thing in this whole world. With you I feel like yes, someone loves me,
          cares for me. You are the favorite that can ever happen to me. Not always
          very rosy and happy, but it is beautiful and real. Thank you for loving me.
        </p>

          I am always grateful for that. Happy Birthday once again, baby 💗.
          I will always pray for the best—the best for you no matter what:
          happiness, all the best opportunities, strength to fight every challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love you so, so much and I am very, very proud of you for however you are.
